## I. Introduction and Purpose of the Project

The visualizations and analyses in this project are the proud product of Shisham's expertise in R and economics, Dominick's background knowledge in Seattle's history of segregation and inequality, and our shared interest in utilizing data science for social good. The inspiration began with interests in learning more about income inequality, gentrification, and segregation of the community that Dominick grew up in.

Dominick had always been told since a young age that North Seattle was for 'white people' and South Seattle is where everyone else lived. In Seattle, being south meant being low income.

Numerous articles have clearly demonstrated through lots of data analysis that there is clear income inequality and de facto racial segregation, but there has never been a clear visual to provide a spatial understanding of this phenomenon.

The visualizations and analyses within this report serve to confirm or deny knowledge that has spread through word of mouth about which place is the 'best to live', 'has no white people', or is 'hella White', and to provide possible explanations for why this is.

Essentially, we are giving non-locals a 'lay of the land' of what the income distribution and racial distribution of Seattle looks like, something that would be hard to learn unless you have local connections.

The value of visualizations like this are increasingly more important in light of the rise of COVID-19 and the demonstrated ways that it has exacerbated inequities around the nation. Policymakers, public health officials, and other public servants must be well-informed of the communities they serve, including knowing exactly where their most at-risk constituents reside.

The findings from our report would be most relevant for those who...

- work in a field that impact Seattle communities (public health, research, policymaker)
- are moving to Seattle and trying to figure out what they should live
- are interested in income inequality
- are interested in gentrification and housing inequality
- are interested in racial inequity and segregation
- are interested in learning about the diverse cultural groups in Seattle!

## II. Navigating this Report

The following short sections will provide important information needed to fully reap the benefits of this report.

### i. Where is Seattle?
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="20%",fig.cap="All counties in Washington (left) and a map of King County (right), the county that Seattle resides in. ",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
# Side-by-side: map of Seattle and judgemental map of Seattle
knitr::include_graphics(c("https://content.lib.washington.edu/imls/kcsnapshots/images/wa-state-map.gif",
                          "https://content.lib.washington.edu/imls/kcsnapshots/images/kc-map.gif"))
``` 

It is important to keep in mind that while Seattle is a major tech-hub and important part of Washington's economy, in the grand scheme of all-Washington things Seattle is very small.

### ii. What does Seattle look like?
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="20%",fig.cap="A map of Seattle side-by-side with a 'judgemental' map sourced by opinions from Seattleites. ",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
# Side-by-side: map of Seattle and judgemental map of Seattle
knitr::include_graphics(c("https://amekorealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Seattle-Neighborhoods.gif",
                          "https://external-preview.redd.it/RHtD1UfHwbt-oZJ_5ttvcz9StulzhOWGE_AZvYhDjWU.jpg?auto=webp&s=8108bfe8054b805ae3323422b93a63aeb7f10cad"))
``` 

In the map above, we can see that Seattle is divided up into a few arbitrary areas. Throughout this report, when we say North Seattle, we won't mean it necessarily in the sense that is demonstrated in the figure above, but in a more simple sense to establish a dichotomy: North Seattle represents the area above the center of Seattle, and South Seattle represents the area below the center of Seattle.

In addition, here is Dominick's attempt to summarize local opinion on the different Seattle areas, utilizing the areas in the figure on the left for reference.

- The northern area of West Seattle and area along the waterfront of West Seattle is known to have relatively higher  

### iii. What is low-income in Seattle?

Our report will be analyzing income inequality, therefore it is important that there is an understanding of what low-income looks like in Seattle, as economies can vary greatly from city to city throughout America.

Shockingly, families of 5 in Seattle with a household income under $102,900 are considered to be low-income, as based on eligibility for low-income [public housing](https://www.seattlehousing.org/housing/sha-housing/eligibility/income-level-low-income-public-housing).

However, low-income in this sense may be too strict as it is a blanket classification based on data from the entire Seattle area. This information is useful nonetheless due to its ability to be compared to the eligibility of low-income public housing in other cities throughout the nation.

From a more practical local perspective, having an income below $102,900 would only be considered low-income if you wanted to live in North Seattle. 

Trying to make it with an income less than this amount in Seattle is easy with just one crazy trick: 'lower your standards' and move south! This is an unfortunate fact of life in Seattle that has led to a lot of the de facto segregation and income inequality we will see throughout this report.

### iv. Navigating our visualizations

Throughout our visualizations, we have utilized markers in different ways to indicate points of analysis. Clicking on a marker will activate a pop-up bubble including important information about the area around the marker and important things to watch out for.

The meat of our report lies within the analyses embedded within these markers (due to our analyses reliance on spatial visualization), while larger overviews will be provided in written form adjacent to the visualization.

We hope that you will be able to take the time to peruse our report and learn more about Seattle's rich diversity that is not typically highlighted in popular media. There are also some 'fun markers' with facts that may be interesting for those interesting in moving to Seattle or just learning about Seattle.

## III. Income Inequality Over the Past Decade

### i. Income Inequality Over Time in King County 
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
income_inequality <- read_csv("2020RATIO053033.csv")
income_inequality <- income_inequality %>%
 rename(Date=DATE, Ratio='2020RATIO053033')
ggplot(income_inequality, aes(x=Date, y=Ratio)) +
  geom_line(color='maroon')+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'lavender'))
```

By looking into the ratio of the mean income for the highest quintile (top 20 percent) of earners divided by the mean income of the lowest quintile (bottom 20 percent) of earners in King's county we can get an idea of income inequality over time. Here we can see that income inequality has sharply risen from 2010 to 2014 and leveled off since then. (Data is based on multiyear "period" estimates derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) data sample collected over time)

This visualization is just one of many that have been created about Seattle to demonstrate its inequities. It is a proven fact that Seattle has inequities, and the purpose of this report is not to contribute to this established body of knowledge, but to provide a different perspective.

The goal of the visualizations in the following parts of this report is to provide a more intuitive spatial understanding of these inequities. It is one thing to 'know' that inequities exist through numbers and graphs, but seeing inequities can have a much larger impact on an individual in understanding this issue.


### ii. Spatial Distribution of Median Income over 2009-2018

Here are our major observations from our spatial visualization of median income over time:

1. Median income increased all across the board.
2. Median income increased at disproportional rates
    
To guide your exploration of these visualizations, we have marked three locations as case studies to watch over time to witness income inequality grow in action.

### iii. Conclusions

**Rising Income**

  Income increased all throughout Seattle due to the economic growth that Seattle's tech boom has provided. Notably, Seattle is home to Amazon headquarters, bringing lots of new white-collar and blue-collar jobs to the area due to Amazon having become such a powerful force over the past decade.
  
  This is also because of Seattle passing a minimum wage law in 2014 that established the long-term plan to increase minimum wage from the \$9/hr it was in 2014 to the \$15/hr it is today. [Learn more here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/seattle-passed-a-15-minimum-wage-law-in-2014-heres-how-its-turned-out-so-far.html).
  
**Income Inequality**
   
   We looked into what could have caused this income inequality. There is [some evidence and counter-evidence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15140326.2019.1620982) that the 2008 recession led to income inequality across the nation. However, a major Seattle development in 2009 is a more likely cause of this issue.
   
   In 2009, the Link Light Rail public transportation system was opened to the public, a long rail line connecting South Seattle to North Seattle that for the first time provided a fast mass public transportation system throughout the Seattle area.
   
   However this new development came with
   
   b. Link light rail grand opening in 2009
      - This train provided high-salary tech workers easy transportation from low-income areas of South Seattle to their workplace in North Seattle. 
      - Even though South Seattle is far away from the workplaces of these tech workers in North Seattle, the train shortened commute times and provided more incentive to move into the low-income southern areas of Seattle.
      - These tech workers indirectly increased rent prices in South Seattle.
      - Many of Dom's peers that he grew up with were forced to move because their families weren't able to afford rent anymore. They were forced to move further south.
      
## IV. Spatial Distribution of Racial Groups

We've demonstrated that Seattle has income inequality issues, but what about racial inequalities? We have provided markers for important locations in the Seattle area, with different analyses for each group. There is a lot of information to take in!

As you dive deep into each marker location and explore our visualization, keep these questions in mind:

- Is it true that the people living in low-income south Seattle areas are mostly people of color? 

- Are there groups of people of color who live in North Seattle?

```{r, include = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Variables for population of racial groups
total_var <- "B02001_001"
white_var <- "B02001_002"
black_var <- "B02001_003"
native_american_var <- "B02001_004"
asian_var <- "B02001_005"
pacific_islander_var <- "B02001_006"

  race_df <- get_wa_data(race_var, year)
  pal <- colorBin(palette = "magma",
                  domain = race_df$estimate,
                  bins = binning)
  race_df %>%
    leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 4, maxZoom = 15, zoomSnap = 0.5)) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addPolygons(popup = paste("<b>", race_df$NAME,
                              "</b></br>", "Number of ", racial_group, "= ", race_df$estimate),
                color = ~pal(estimate),
                stroke = TRUE,
                weight = 1,
                opacity = 0.5,
                fillOpacity = 0.5) %>%
    addLegend("topright", pal = pal, 
              values = ~estimate,
              title = paste("Number of ", racial_group, " in ", year),
              opacity = 1) %>%
    setView(lat = latitude, lng = longitude, zoom)
}
```

### iii. Asians

We can see that Asians have similar distributions to Blacks, demonstrating that people of color tend to live near other people of color in the Seattle area.

However, it is important to take note of a major difference in the downtown Seattle area!

### iv. Native Americans

(LEAFLET MARKER) Native Americans live around Duwamish River. An explanation for this is the presence of the Duwamish Tribe.

```

### vi. Conclusions

There are important limitations of the visualizations above that we must highlight.

These racial data visualizations were not able to highlight the unique experiences of certain ethnic groups such as Latinos and Asian subgroups. 

There are health disparities, language needs, and educational disparities that can be remedied through targeting these specific groups.

Here are a couple questions the visualizations above brought to mind:

- Who 

## V. Spatial Distribution of Ethnic Groups

We decided to track these subgroups utilizing the language spoken at home, which are major indicators of ethnicity.

We used data from 2014 due to difficulties getting language data from 2018. (TODO: WHY?)

}
```

### i. Hispanics

Hispanics tend to be living in the unincorporated areas south of Seattle that tend to be more underresourced than those living in the southern skirts of Seattle.

By zooming out, you can see a marker in eastern Washington. Another important thing to note is that there are much larger populations of Latinos in Eastern Washington, where the costs of living are much cheaper. Latinos also make-up the majority of the workforce in Washington's booming agriculture industry, to which Eastern Washington is home to.

#### a. Distribution of Hispanics, 2014

```

### ii. Cambodians
We discovered another limitation to our data visualizations. The data did not accurately reflect the population of Khmer individuals in the Seattle area. This is dangerous as individuals who are not familiar with the Khmer community in Seattle may take this data to be more accurate than it is in reality.

In this visualization, we can see that there are virtually no Khmer individuals in South Seattle (LEAFLET MARKER), when in actuality, there are numerous Khmer communities, temples, and youth groups. (LEAFLET MARKER) We can also see that there are lots of Khmer individuals in Bellevue, one of Seattle's sister cities and a high income city. One could interpret this to mean that the Khmer population in Seattle is a small, but affluential population, when it is far from that.

The Khmer population are refugees who escaped a genocide in Cambodia about 40 years ago. Most of them live in South Seattle, with limited English ability and typically low levels of education due to the fact that most education folks in Cambodia were executed.

(MARKER) White Center shows that there are an estimated 0 Khmer individuals in the area, which directly contradicts the presence of Cambodian supermarkets, restaurants, and temples.

An explanation for this severe undercounting can be explained through the American Community Survey (ACS), which this data is sourced from. Although it is required to take the ACS, an illiteracy in English and a fear of deportation are significant reasons that Khmer individuals would fail to take the ACS survey mailed to them.

This highlights that there are important accessibility measures that must be taken by ACS to remedy this issue. It also highlights the importance of community outreach and education, to which there has been a huge movement in the Khmer community recently, as many youth are advocating their older generations of the trustworthiness of the survey and its inability to affect immigration issues.

```

### iv. Conclusions

Must fill this part out eventually.

## VI. Limitations

While this report has a lot of useful visualizations that can be used for a variety of important applications, it is important to note some notable limitations.

As evidenced by the case study on Cambodians in Seattle, the data used in this study is not an accurate representation of all groups in Seattle. Data visualizations like these cannot be trusted unless you are able to get community input that will provide useful insight that cannot be seen through the numbers.

Therefore, we must admit that we have not been able to get input from all the communities in this study. Dominick has significant connections with the Cambodian and Vietnamese community so therefore he has been able to provide those populations an accurate representation.

Other groups in this study have not been given the same treatment, therefore these results must not be taken as truth, but as an indicator.

In addition, this report was completed in a relatively short amount of time which was not enough time to provide an ample analysis of all groups.

Future iterations of this project would need more community input and a more detailed analysis of the experiences of all groups in the large area that is Seattle.

## VII. Final Implications

Spatial visualizations like these are vital for public servants to do their job in an equitable manner.

On July 31st 2020, just last week (at the time of publication), a [free COVID-19 testing site](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/seattle-to-open-another-free-coronavirus-testing-location-to-reach-more-bipoc/) was announced to open in the Rainier Beach neighborhood of South Seattle due to the high populations of Black, Latino, and other populations of color that are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. This was a vital policy decision that was informed by data analyses like ours. Without data available like this, policy decisions would be made 'blind' and be a much more ineffective process leaving many communites of color susceptible to institutional neglect.

This data analyses can be applied to areas besides health care, such as education. Seattle has large populations of non-native English speakers that require special resources in language education. By knowing where these non-native English speakers live, resources can be more effectively distributed to these populations in order to utiize district funds more efficiently, while also uplifting students of color. Education is one of many fields where this data could be used to inform policy decisions for social and economic good, such as immigration reform, drug abuse intervention and prevention, and housing discrimination.

Lastly, these issues are vital tools in the fight against the racial pandemic in America. The Black Lives Matter movement has experienced a rapid gain in traction from many companies, demographics, and communities that had previously not supported the movement, which is vital to having change being enacted. Unfortunately, there are still large swathes of individuals who do not support BLM due to a variety of reasons, which a major reason being a lack of consciousness in the racial inequities that plague our country. There are individuals who may say that they 'know' there are racial inequities, but do not feel it is a big enough problem to justify the movement. Data visualizations like these are powerful tools to raise the racial consciousness of individuals within our society. It is hard to look at these harsh disparities face-to-face and sincerely believe that this is not an issue worth fighting for.
