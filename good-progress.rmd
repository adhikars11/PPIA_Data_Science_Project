## I. Introduction and Purpose of the Project

The inspiration behind this project began with interests in learning more about income inequality, gentrification, and segregation of the community that Dominick grew up in.

A 'fact of life' that Dominick had discovered at a young age was that North Seattle is where wealthy white people live, while South Seattle is where everyone else lived; living further South directly correlated with lower income. However, he had never seen this phenomenon mapped out. It is relatively well-known by those who live here that Seattle is segregated, and there have been articles about segregation in Seattle, but there has never been a visualization of this segregation. The visualizations and analyses in this project are the product of Shisham's expertise in R and economics, Dominick's background knowledge in Seattle's history of segregation and inequality, and our shared interest in utilizing data science for social good.

The presence of a visualization would allow us to provide the important service of 
fact checking this knowledge that has spread through word of month. The presence of a visualization would also give newcomers to Seattle a 'lay of the land' of what the income distribution and racial distribution of Seattle looks like, something that would be hard to learn unless you have local connections. The value of visualizations 
like this are increasingly more important in light of the rise of COVID-19 
and the demonstrated ways that it has exacerbated inequities around the nation. 
Policymakers, public health officials, and other public servants must be well-informed of the communities they serve, including knowing exactly where their most at-risk constituents reside.

This report will provide an overview of recent events that have impacted income
inequality, gentrification, and racial inequity in Seattle, such as the 
2008 economic crisis, Seattle's tech boom, and deployment of the Link light rail
public transportation system in 2009.

The findings from our report would be most relevant for those who...

- work in a field that impact Seattle communities (public health, research, policymaker)
- are moving to Seattle and trying to figure out what they should live
- are interested in income inequality
- are interested in gentrification and housing inequality
- are interested in racial inequity and segregation
- are interested in learning about the diverse cultural groups in Seattle!

## II. Navigating this Report

This section serves to provide important context for the Seattle area so that those unacquainted with the area will be able to navigate our spatial maps better. This also serves to provide information on how to get the most out of this report.

``` 

#### iii. What is low-income in Seattle?

Our report will be analyzing income inequality, therefore it is important that there is an understanding of what low-income looks like in Seattle, as economies can vary greatly from city to city throughout America.

Facts:

- In Seattle, families of 5 with a household income under $102,900 are considered low-income. (Based on eligibility for low-income public housing https://www.seattlehousing.org/housing/sha-housing/eligibility/income-level-low-income-public-housing)
- WILL ADD MORE LATER

#### iv. Navigating our visualizations

Throughout our visualizations, we have utilized markers in different ways to indicate points that are worth further explanation. Clicking on a marker will activate a pop-up bubble including important information about the area around the marker and important things to watch out for.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

## III. Income Inequality Over the Past Decade

### i. Income Inequality Over Time in King County 
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
income_inequality <- read_csv("2020RATIO053033.csv")
income_inequality <- income_inequality %>%
 rename(Date=DATE, Ratio='2020RATIO053033')
ggplot(income_inequality, aes(x=Date, y=Ratio)) +
  geom_line(color='maroon')+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'lavender'))
```

We can look into the ratio of the mean income for the highest quintile (top 20 percent) of earners divided by the mean income of the lowest quintile (bottom 20 percent) of earners in King's county to get an idea of income inequality over time. The data is based on multiyear "period" estimates derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) data sample collected over time. 
### ii. Spatial Distribution of Median Income over 2009-2018

Here are our major observations from graphing median income over time (below):

1. Median income increased all across the board.
2. Median income increased at disproportional rates: 
    - Median income in North Seattle grew a lot more than in South Seattle
    
To guide your exploration of these visualizations, we have marked three locations to watch over time as case studies for income inequality in action.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Function to draw map of income with nice binning.
incomeMap <- function(income_df, year){
  pal <- colorBin(palette = "magma",

}
```

                 "This area in the New Holly neighborhood goes through very little growth, from a median income of $38,909 to $53,300, a growth of about $15k. This slow growth of income can be seen in other areas of South Seattle, in contrast to the large growth of income in North Seattle, an indicator of income inequality in action.")

### iii. Conclusions

1. Cause of Rising Income
   a. Seattle's tech boom (amazon, microsoft, google, etc.)
      - More tech workers more income! and more gentrification and higher rent...

2. Two Major Causes of Income Inequality in Seattle
   a. 2008 economic crisis exacerbated income inequalities. 
      - my source of this is wikipedia:
          - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession#Overview
          - The distribution of household incomes in the United States became more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery.
          - Income inequality in the United States grew from 2005 to 2012 in more than two-thirds of metropolitan areas

   b. Link light rail grand opening in 2009
      - This train provided high-salary tech workers easy transportation from low-income areas of South Seattle to their workplace in North Seattle. 
      - Even though South Seattle is far away from the workplaces of these tech workers in North Seattle, the train shortened commute times and provided more incentive to move into the low-income southern areas of Seattle.
      - These tech workers indirectly increased rent prices in South Seattle.
      - Many of Dom's peers that he grew up with were forced to move because their families weren't able to afford rent anymore. They were forced to move further south.
      
## IV. Spatial Distribution of Racial Groups

We've demonstrated that Seattle has income inequality issues, but what about racial inequalities?

We have provided markers for important locations in the Seattle area, with different analyses for each group. 

There is a lot of information to take in!

As you dive deep into each marker location and explore our visualization, keep these questions in mind:

- Is it true that the people living in low-income south Seattle areas are mostly people of color? 

- Are there groups of people of color who live in North Seattle?

```{r, include = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Variables for population of racial groups
total_var <- "B02001_001"
white_var <- "B02001_002"
black_var <- "B02001_003"
native_american_var <- "B02001_004"
asian_var <- "B02001_005"
pacific_islander_var <- "B02001_006"
other_race_var <- c("B02001_007", "B02001_008", "B02001_009", "B02001_010")

raceMap <- function(race_var, year, racial_group, binning, latitude = 47.600315, longitude = -122.331961, zoom = 10.5){
  race_df <- get_wa_data(race_var, year)
  pal <- colorBin(palette = "magma",
                  domain = race_df$estimate,
                  bins = binning)
  race_df %>%
    leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 4, maxZoom = 15, zoomSnap = 0.5)) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addPolygons(popup = paste("<b>", race_df$NAME,
                              "</b></br>", "Number of ", racial_group, "= ", race_df$estimate),
                color = ~pal(estimate),
                stroke = TRUE,
                weight = 1,
                opacity = 0.5,
                fillOpacity = 0.5) %>%
    addLegend("topright", pal = pal, 
              values = ~estimate,
              title = paste("Number of ", racial_group, " in ", year),
              opacity = 1) %>%
    setView(lat = latitude, lng = longitude, zoom)
}
```

### iii. Asians

We can see that Asians have similar distributions to Blacks, demonstrating that people of color tend to live near other people of color in the Seattle area.

However, it is important to take note of a major difference in the downtown Seattle area!

### vi. Conclusions

There are important limitations of the visualizations above that we must highlight.

These racial data visualizations were not able to highlight the unique experiences of certain ethnic groups such as Latinos and Asian subgroups. 

There are health disparities, language needs, and educational disparities that can be remedied through targeting these specific groups.

Here are a couple questions the visualizations above brought to mind:

- Who 

## V. Spatial Distribution of Ethnic Groups

We decided to track these subgroups utilizing the language spoken at home, which are major indicators of ethnicity.

We used data from 2014 due to difficulties getting language data from 2018. (TODO: WHY?)

}
```

### i. Hispanics

Hispanics tend to be living in the unincorporated areas south of Seattle that tend to be more underresourced than those living in the southern skirts of Seattle.

By zooming out, you can see a marker in eastern Washington. Another important thing to note is that there are much larger populations of Latinos in Eastern Washington, where the costs of living are much cheaper. Latinos also make-up the majority of the workforce in Washington's booming agriculture industry, to which Eastern Washington is home to.

### ii. Cambodians
We discovered another limitation to our data visualizations. The data did not accurately reflect the population of Khmer individuals in the Seattle area. This is dangerous as individuals who are not familiar with the Khmer community in Seattle may take this data to be more accurate than it is in reality.

In this visualization, we can see that there are virtually no Khmer individuals in South Seattle (LEAFLET MARKER), when in actuality, there are numerous Khmer communities, temples, and youth groups. (LEAFLET MARKER) We can also see that there are lots of Khmer individuals in Bellevue, one of Seattle's sister cities and a high income city. One could interpret this to mean that the Khmer population in Seattle is a small, but affluential population, when it is far from that.

The Khmer population are refugees who escaped a genocide in Cambodia about 40 years ago. Most of them live in South Seattle, with limited English ability and typically low levels of education due to the fact that most education folks in Cambodia were executed.

(MARKER) White Center shows that there are an estimated 0 Khmer individuals in the area, which directly contradicts the presence of Cambodian supermarkets, restaurants, and temples.

An explanation for this severe undercounting can be explained through the American Community Survey (ACS), which this data is sourced from. Although it is required to take the ACS, an illiteracy in English and a fear of deportation are significant reasons that Khmer individuals would fail to take the ACS survey mailed to them.

This highlights that there are important accessibility measures that must be taken by ACS to remedy this issue. It also highlights the importance of community outreach and education, to which there has been a huge movement in the Khmer community recently, as many youth are advocating their older generations of the trustworthiness of the survey and its inability to affect immigration issues.

### v. Conclusions

Must fill this part out eventually.

## VI. Final Implications

1. COVID-19 example from a few days ago 
    - https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/seattle-to-open-another-free-coronavirus-testing-location-to-reach-more-bipoc/
    - The aim of the two new locations is to reach more of the city’s Black and Indigenous people and other people of color, many of whom call the South End home, Mayor Jenny Durkan said during a news conference Friday.
    - “Sadly, for our communities of color, and particularly for Black and Latinx communities, this crisis has disproportionally hit them,” she said.
    
2. Educational disparities
    - determine where youth who are non-native english speakers live
    - for example, if we know where latino students are centrally located, bilingual education resources can be targeted more efficiently
    - utilizes school district budgets more effectively
    
3. Highlights racial disparities in a time of need
    - BLM is a movement gaining wide support, and for good reason
    - not everyone agrees with movement. there are those who don't believe that there is systemic racism in today's world
    - these visualizations demonstrate systemic racial inequality exacerbated by an economic crisis and poorly implemented public transportation systems
    - the individual actions of minorities cannot account for these drastic changes in such a short amount of time (~10 years)
    - these drastic inequalities must be the result of systemic issues
